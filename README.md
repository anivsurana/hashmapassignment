# CSE 1320 Assignment 5

This assignment covers binary search trees, hash maps, macros, and makefiles.

Your code must compile without any warnings or errors and run without segmentation faults to receive credit. Any allocated memory must be freed.

# Problem 1 - Monster Search Tree

## Picking a Key

Binary search trees require that each node has a unique key. The key should be comparable to others in the tree. For this part of the assignment, create a function `int get_key(monster_s *monster)` that returns a unique integer based on the name of the monster. There are no limitations on this function, but it should be deterministic. That is, given the same input, it should always return the same output.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `get_key` in `monster_utils.c`.

## Binary Search Tree

Use the example code from class to create a binary search tree that stores `monster_s` objects. The tree should be implemented in `monster_tree.c` and `monster_tree.h`. The `monster_s` struct is defined in `monster_utils.h`. The functions provided [in the example code](https://github.com/ajdillhoff/CSE1320-Examples/blob/main/binary_trees/bt_utils.c) need to be modified to take advantage of the key function you created in the previous part.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement the binary search tree in `monster_tree.c` and `monster_tree.h`.
- [ ] Modify `struct BTNode` in `monster_tree.h` to include a `key` member and change the `data` member to a `monster_s` pointer.
- [ ] Modify the functions in `bt_utils.c` to use the key function you created.

## Balancing the Tree

Since there are no functions to rebalance the tree, organize the data in the given files so that inserting the data into the tree will result in a balanced tree.

## Testing the Program

Create a new program defined in `monster_tree.c` that takes a filename as input. The program should immediately load the data from the file and insert each monster into a binary search tree. The program should then print the tree in order.

Prompt the user to enter a monster name to search for. If the monster is found, print the monster's information. If the monster is not found, print a message indicating that the monster was not found.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement the program in `monster_tree.c`.
- [ ] Test the program with the provided data files.

# Problem 2 - Monster Map

## The `Makefile`

When working with larger codebases, it is easy to get overwhelmed. Any obstacles encountered, no matter how small, can seem insurmountable. Our first task is to modify our `Makefile` for our project. This will make it simple to compile our project and test the different components we will be adding.

Feel free to use [the example we did in class](https://github.com/ajdillhoff/CSE1320-Examples/tree/main/make) or the cookbook from [makefiletutorial.com](https://makefiletutorial.com/#makefile-cookbook) to get started.

### Tasks

- [ ] Modify the `Makefile` with the following targets:
    - `debug`: Builds the project with the flags `-g -Wall`.
- [ ] Verify that your `Makefile` works by building the project and running it.

## Computing the Index

In `monster_map.c`, create the following functions:
- `int hash_fn(void *key)` - Computes the hash value for a given key.
- `int compute_index(void *key, int map_size)` - Computes the index for a given key and map size.

Feel free to use the examples we did in class or experiment with creating your own hash functions. Since both of these will be passed as members to the `hash_map_t` struct, they should have the same signature.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `hash_fn` in `monster_map.c`.
- [ ] Implement `compute_index` in `monster_map.c`.

## Collision Resolution using Quadratic Probing

One flaw of linear probing for collision resolution is that samples tend to cluster together in different parts of the map. An alternative open addressing scheme that does not suffer from clustering is [**quadratic probing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing).

Quadratic probing computes a new index based on the result of a hash function and quadratic function. Let $h(k)$ be the original hash function. The new index is computed as

$$
h(k, i) = h(k) + c_1 i + c_2 i^2.
$$

Create a function `int quadratic_probe(int hash, int i, int c1, int c2)` that computes the function above. The input arguments are:
- `int hash` - The original hash value computed by the hash function.
- `int i` - The parameter `i` as described above.
- `int c1` - The first coefficient of the function.
- `int c2` - The second coefficient of the function.

This function will also allow you to explore the effects of changing the coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$. In most cases, you might use a default implementation where $c_1 = c_2 = 1$. For this case, create a macro that defines a function call `default_probe(hash, i)` to call the function `quadratic_probe(hash, i, 1, 1)`.

Add this function to `monster_map.c`. The macro definition should be placed at the top of `monster_map.c`.

Create a function `int probe_fn(int index, int i, int map_size)` that calls the macro `default_probe` and returns the result modulo `map_size`. This function will be used as the probe function for the hash map.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `quadratic_probe` in `monster_map.c`.
- [ ] Add macro for function.
- [ ] Test the function by computing it by hand with a known input. Your implementation should produce the same value as calculated by hand.
- [ ] Implement `probe_fn` in `monster_map.c`.

## Monster Map

Complete the program that uses a hash map with open addressing via quadratic probing and incremental rehashing. The hash map will store `monster_s` objects using the same data format as assignment 2.

**`monster_s` struct**

```
typdef struct {
    char *name;
    char *type;
    int hp;
    int ac;
    int str;
    int dex;
    int con;
} monster_s;
```

The keys for this map will be the names of each `monster_s`.

## Adding a Monster

The program should allow users to add monsters from `stdin` as well as the ability to import from a CSV file. For the first task, implement option 1 on the main menu in `monster_map.c` by first creating a new `monster_s` object using data entered by the user and then inserting that into the hash map. There are already functions provided to do both of these things. For this part, you will need to complete the function `add_monster` in `monster_map.c`.

When adding an individual `monster_s`, make sure they are not already in the hash map. If it is, warn the user and return to the main menu. Test that your code works by compiling and running it. You should be able to add a few monsters without incident.

### Tasks

- [ ] Verify the monster is unique by using the `search` function.
- [ ] If it is unique, add it to the hash map.
- [ ] If it already exists, free the memory allocated for this monster.

## Bulk Import from CSV File

For option 2, the program should load data from a CSV file and insert the unique entries in the hash map. Since we know ahead of time how many samples are to be added, the map size should be reserved to accommodate all entries without rehashing.

One approach to implementing this option would be:
1. Load all monsters from a CSV file into an array (use `array_s`).
2. Determine the unique entries in the array using `search`. Remove any entries from the array that are already in the map.
3. Insert the entries into the map based on the number of unique monsters by completing the `bulk_insert` function in `monster_map.c`.

The first two steps are already implemented.

The third step requires some consideration since the map may currently be in the process of rehashing. In that case, items in the bulk array should be inserted sequentially to allow the rehashing to complete. Then the map should be resized again such that all remaining unique entries from the file can be entered without triggering another rehash.

### Tasks

- [ ] Pass the array to `bulk_insert` in `hash_map_utils.c`. You will need to complete this function following the description above.
- [ ] In `hash_map_utils.h`, create a macro to calculate the bucket size of a map given the number of keys $n$ and a load factor bound $b$:

$$
k \geq \Big\lceil\frac{n}{b}\Big\rceil
$$

## Searching the Map

The hash map library has no prior information on the data that it is storing. In order to search or insert new elements, the library needs instructions on how to compare two keys. Complete the function `int key_equals(void *key1, void *key2)` in `monster_map.c`. This function should return `1` if the two keys are equal and `0` otherwise.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement `key_equals` in `monster_map.c`.

## Cleaning Up

It is important to free any allocated data that is no longer being used. Complete the `free_monster` function in `monster_utils.c`. **Note** that this function expects a `void *` object as its first parameter as it will be used as a function pointer. The reasoning is because the hash map functions do not know exactly what type of data they will be storing, so they cannot possibly know how to free a specific data type.

This function should free the data allocated to each string as well as the data for the `monster_s` object itself.

### Tasks

- [ ] Complete the `free_monster` function in `monster_utils.c`.
- [ ] Make sure all dynamically allocated memory is freed before the program exits.
